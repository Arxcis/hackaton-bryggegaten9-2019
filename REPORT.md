## Log

### Saturday

#### 17:00 - setting up React devenv

- Using facebooks script for setting up a pre-configured react environment - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app


#### 10:00 - Brainstorming

- Discussing several ideas.
- Divying up into groups.
- I'm working in my own repo, but am going to present to the rest of the participanty

**Constraints**
- Use React as a frontend framework
- Use Mapbox for displaying maps
- Main mission is to create a test, to test if using a PWA app is "good enough" for a special use case.
- Another group is solving the same problem, but trying to use Mapbox native SDK.
- Basically my project is about proving, that the other group is wasting their time, having separate code bases for each platform.
